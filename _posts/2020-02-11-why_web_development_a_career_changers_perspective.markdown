**Lots of Positions** 

When deciding what you want to do for the next 10 to 20 years, a key criterion has to be job availability. Web or software development is only going to be needed more and more. There are many studies out there that show a twenty per cent increase in development careers until 2025. It certainly makes sense to look into a career that is really needed versus one that is declining!

**No Grad School**

A key to someone like myself is what exactly does it take to change into a new career. Having gone to college over 25 years ago that wasn't really an option again. Switching to web development allows me to do something I like while also learning in more non-traditional ways. Take, for instance, Flat Iron School, which you can take in a classroom or online. The amount of time to finish is determined by you and your schedule! You decide when and where to study so that it behoves you.

**Work flexibility**

Web development offers a lot of the perks that tech companies now use to keep people more productive. As someone who has worked from home a lot and had a flexible schedule, programming allows me the same freedom. Many careers have those benefits already set in place for their workers because they optimize performance. I would have a hard time being locked in a desk/office for 9 hours a day every day and development gives me a lot of flexibility.

**Creativity**

For me personally, any career needs to have a certain amount of creativity to keep me engaged. Web Development has a ton of creativity and problem solving because there are so many ways to solve problems. Every developer can solve or design completely different than the person sitting next to them and neither is wrong. Being able to think of many different scenarios to solve every problem keeps me on my toes.

**It is Dynamic**

Since this is a relatively new field there are always changes in the work. New languages come up on a  yearly basis based on need and demand. Since development is so dynamic one needs to keep learning and revising their best practices to succeed. This constant changing keeps perspective and development fun and engaging. In three years from now, I most likely will be developing in a different language than I am using and this is great for personal enjoyment.

**Work in all areas**

One of the key criteria when looking for my next career was the ability to work in any sector. Web Development allows you to work in nearly any type of company, school or non-profit. Wherever you want to make a difference they will have a need for software or web development. This not only helps you find the perfect job position but also allows you to work for a cause or belief that is important to you.

**Large community**

Finally, I wanted to be part of a large community! It is when engrained in a large pool of people with like-minded thoughts and skills that I feel most engaged. The web development community is one that spreads across the entire world and shares and works together all the time. I also believe this community is a kind-hearted one that strives for making the world a better place. 

Well, there you have it. A short list of my top reasons to get into web and software development. There are actually a lot more but these were on the top of my mind when I made the switch.
