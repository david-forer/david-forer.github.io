I have already written a piece on my final project yet feel compelled to write a little more. React with Redux was a very tough concept for me to get my hands around. I think the reason is more that you should understand React before you do something with Redux. It would be best if you comprehended Javascript before learning React. While looking over what I have done, I can't help but think this section should have been divided into two separate projects.

So I spent some extra time learning React as best I could while still moving forward. I think it was harder to learn because you are learning javascript and react. While I have knowledge of Javascript, there was not the time for mastery at learn.co. I will go back to JS and know it better before moving around to React, which is actually what I want to learn.

While implementing redux, I felt as if I needed to understand my flow. By this, I mean how is it I want to code in redux around react? It is a concept that you do specific things every time you use it. My flow is to start with my reducer to see it in the redux dev tools extension. After that, I like to build my form or whatever page I am posting to. Finally, I add my actions so that it all works together. I think the dev tools kit was a lifesaver for not just troubleshooting but reminding me of what I needed to do.

Just some random thoughts about what I did while coding the React/Redux project. I learned a ton while doing all the tasks necessary for completion. I highly recommend doing redux over and over. It not only helps cement the workflow but also forces you to get React working as well. I feel like React gives you a lot more wiggle room as it is on the creative side, while redux is more concrete and needs a lot of repetition to be good at it..
